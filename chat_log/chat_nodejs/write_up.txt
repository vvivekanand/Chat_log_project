Project Name : Chatlog


>> The chatlog which we created is having a single server where multiple users can add their data (by adding the message in message section).


>> The following modules should be installed to work with this application

   express, bodyparser, http, socket.io, mongoose, node


>> And below are the some commands to install those modules in our vs code

  -->> npm install node

  -->> npm install express

  -->> npm install bodyparser

  -->> npm install http

  -->> npm install socket.io

  -->> npm install mongoose

  -->> node server.js // (to connect with the server)
 
>> When a user connect to the server (localhost:3000) and adds some message in the message section that particular message will display in the same page

>> And the same message will get stored in the collection inside the mongocompass

 --> databse used -->> (chat)

 --> collection used -->> (messages)

>> In this way the message will gets stored in both the server and mongocompass.

>> when an another user connect to the same server then that user can also see the recent data which is stored already by other users.
